# Prediction-and-Analysis-of-Air-Traffic-Data
# Air Traffic Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing air traffic passenger statistics using ARIMA modeling to forecast future trends. The analysis is based on historical data to predict the number of passengers over time.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains air traffic passenger statistics by airline and includes:

- **Number of Passengers**: Monthly count of passengers.
- **Airlines**: Operating and published airlines.
- **Geographic Regions**: Regions associated with the flights.
- **Activity Types**: Types of activities (commercial, private, etc.).
- **Price Categories**: Economy, business, and first-class categories.
- **Terminals and Boarding Areas**: Specific areas within airports.
- **Dates**: Year and month of the data.

The data is from Open Flights for the year 2017 and is valuable for understanding airline industry trends and forecasting passenger volumes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, formatting date columns, and standardizing numerical columns for accurate time series analysis.

2. **ARIMA Modeling**:
   - Developed an ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict future passenger counts based on historical data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model performance by comparing the predicted values against the actual observed data.
   - Used metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for validation.

## Results

### 1. Observed vs. Predicted Passenger Counts

The following graph shows the comparison between the observed passenger counts and the predicted values generated by the ARIMA model.

### 2. Passenger Count Forecast

The forecast graph displays the predicted number of passengers for the next year based on the ARIMA model.
